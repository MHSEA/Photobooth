##Hands On Windows 10 Coding Lab: The Amazing Automatic Photo Booth
Computers get more personal by the day – we’re increasingly carrying them, wearing them, talking to them and writing on their displays and the only thing moving faster than the technology are our expectations of it.
App developers are increasingly incorporating these kinds of experiences into their code and it’s becoming easier than you might think to do it.
In this hands-on coding lab you can try it out for yourself by building the “Amazing Automatic Photo Booth” with;

1.	Auto Person On™: the booth will switch itself on when it sees a person in front of the webcam.
2.	Cheese O Matic™: the booth will automatically take a photo when the person says “cheese!”.
3.	Annotatification™: the booth will let the user annotate their photo with handwriting to produce a neatly formatted title.

##What You’ll Need to Take Part
- You’ll need a PC running Windows 10 and the Visual Studio 2015 Update 1 Development Environment. Make sure to select the "Universal Windows App Development Tools"
For most setups you can grab these for free from the web or, if you prefer to virtualize, then you can grab pre-configured images for VMWare, Hyper-V, VirtualBox, Parallels. 

- Remember that you’ll need access to the webcam, microphone to get the most from the labs.
